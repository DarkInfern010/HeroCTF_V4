Little WU for Poney and SSHs

# SSHs - Prog
Every user can read the private rsa key of the next user. You just have to grab it, and ssh as the next. But... there are 250 ?!?
Let's automate it ! (The last user has a flag.txt at the root of his home directory)

# Pixel Poney - Prog
I'm not in a mood of writing riddle as an explanation for this challenge, so I'm gonna be straight with you. Those numbers in the input file represent pixel, and the image you seek has a width of 3500 pixels. See ya
